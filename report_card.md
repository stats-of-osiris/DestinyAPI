###### Definitions

[^1]:**Sweaty** stats are based on matches where the enemy team wins at least 3 rounds.

[^2]:
    **Percent contribution** is a metric for determining how much you helped or hindered your team. I started with the points that Destiny awards natively and tweaked them for Trials.

    - +100 for kills, -100 for deaths,

    - +33 for assists, +25 for rezzes, +12 for being rezzed.

    Scores are tabulated across all games for individuals and the team. And then a player's contribution is shown as percent of the team's total score.

[^3]:
    **Last Guardian Actions** are:

    - *'Never Say Die'* = Kill an enemy as the last guardian standing.

    - *'From the Brink'* = Revive a teammate as the last guardian standing.
